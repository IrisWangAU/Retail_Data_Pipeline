## üî¨ Project Overview 

Walmart is the biggest retail store in the United States. Just like others, they have been expanding their e-commerce part of the business. By the end of 2022, e-commerce represented a roaring $80 billion in sales, which is 13% of total sales of Walmart. One of the main factors that affects their sales is public holidays, like the Super Bowl, Labour Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. 

In this project, I build a ETL data pipeline for the analysis of supply and demand around the holidays, along with conducting a preliminary analysis of the data.

<br>

### üíæ Dataset

There are two data sources: grocery sales and complementary data.

The `grocery_sales` table have the following features:

<br>

#### **`grocery_sales`**
- `"index"` - unique ID of the row
- `"Store_ID"` - the store number
- `"Date"` - the week of sales
- `"Weekly_Sales"` - sales for the given store

The `extra_data.parquet` file contains complementary data:

#### **`extra_data.parquet`**
- `"IsHoliday"` - Whether the week contains a public holiday - 1 if yes, 0 if no.
- `"Temperature"` - Temperature on the day of sale
- `"Fuel_Price"` - Cost of fuel in the region
- `"CPI"` ‚Äì Prevailing consumer price index
- `"Unemployment"` - The prevailing unemployment rate
- `"MarkDown1"`, `"MarkDown2"`, `"MarkDown3"`, `"MarkDown4"` - number of promotional markdowns
- `"Dept"` - Department Number in each store
- `"Size"` - size of the store
- `"Type"` - type of the store (depends on `Size` column)

The two files need to be merged and manipulated. The transformed DataFrame can then be stored as the `clean_data` variable containing the following columns:
- `"Store_ID"`
- `"Month"`
- `"Dept"`
- `"IsHoliday"`
- `"Weekly_Sales"`
- `"CPI"`
- `"Unemployment"`

After merging and cleaning the data, the monthly sales of Walmart are stored  as the `agg_data` variable that look like:

|  Month | Weekly_Sales  | 
|---|---|
| 01  |  33174.178494 |
|  02 |  34333.326579 |
|  ... | ...  |  

Finally, the `clean_data` and `agg_data` files are stored as csv files.

<br>

### üéØ Project Goals

- Load data from Parquet and CSV files into DataFrame.
- Transform the data into the desired clean format.
- Calculate the average weekly sales by month.
- Save the cleaned data into a CSV file.
- Validate the existence of the final cleaned data in the CSV file.
- Create a data visualization in Power BI.

## üïµÔ∏è Key Insights

- üí∏ **Total Sales by Month**
  - The total E-commerce revenue for Walmart across all files amounts to 3.63 billion.
  - Among all the months, Walmart has the highest revenue in April (0.35 billion), followed by July (0.34 billion) and December (0.33 billion). January has the lowest revenue, at 0.17 billion
 
- üåç **Average Weekly Sales by Month**
  - The average weekly sales are significantly impacted by holidays such as the Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.
  - In December, Walmart experiences the highest weekly sales (over 38K), followed by November (over 36K).
  > This trend can be attributed to increased consumer purchasing at Walmart in preparation for Christmas.

<a name="data-extraction"></a>
### üì§ Data Ingestion
- Extract Data from source file

![extract](https://github.com/IrisWangAU/Retail_Data_Pipeline/blob/main/asset/Extract.PNG)

<br>

<a name="data-transformation"></a>
### ‚öôÔ∏è Data Transformation

- Fill NAs in Date, CPI, Unemployment with the last non-null values.
- Drop any rows with missing values in weekly sales and keep only rows with sales revenue above 10K.
- Create a new column for Month from the Date Column.
- Create a new Data Frame for Average Weekly Sales by Month using aggregation.
